I compiled this cheatsheet from a variety of materials, including two books, the O'Reilly Master Class, the git man pages, and some online stuff. I used the Adobe fonts Optima and Helvetica Condensed on my Mac; the Windows font corresponding to Optima is often Zapf Humanist. I designed it for maximum readability and information content in the minimum space. 

You'll find both the PDF and the original Word document. Feel free to comment below or branch if you have any additions or corrections.
